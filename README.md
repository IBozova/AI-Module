# Data-Science
In this repo I have included my assignments from the 2 modules I successfully passed out of the 4 of the AI module I am currently taking.\
The starting one - Math for Devs is matematically orientated course in which math concepts as noted below are coded instead of calculated:\
• Calculus\
• Linear Algebra\
• Probability and combinatorics\

• Hypothesys Testing\
\
The exercises are using Python as main language and it utilizes libraries such as: \
